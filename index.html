<h1>THE TEST SITE</h1>
<h2>Why this image?</h2>
<h3>What is the interest?</h3>
<h4>To learn to programming and link it with the education</h4>

      <p>This is a <strong>single paragraph</strong> that I use like a test. It´s my first site and my first programming experiment. So, I would like to begin with a <b>Bertrand Russel</b> quote: <i>"Fear is the main source of supestition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom"</i> </p>
<p>In this page, I´d like to share a few of reflections about the following items:</p>
      
<ul> 
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Technology and education</li>
  <li>Philosophy of sciences</li>
  <li>Learning</li>
  <li>Scientific education</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I hope I´ll do it well </p>
<p>I´m learning with the help of Mozilla. So, I´d like to share the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a> to learn more about the values and principle that guide the pursuit of their mission. </p>
